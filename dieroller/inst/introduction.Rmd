## Die Rolling

The package `"dieroll"` is a minimal implementation for simulating rolling
a die a given number of times, and to visualize the relative frequencies
in such a series of rolls.


## Creating a `die`

The first step is to create a `"die"` object with the function `die()`:

```{r}
mydie<- die()
mydie
```

By default, `die()` creates a fair die with standard sides 1,2,3,4,5,6, and with probability values for each side of 1/6.

You can change the defatuls with arguments `sides` and `prob`:

```{r}
loaded <- die(sides = c('A','B','C','D','E','F'), prob = c(0.4,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.2))
loaded
```
